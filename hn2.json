    "text": "I want to draw attention to Bob Lee, a well-respected technologist and prototype hacker, always curious and sharing lots of interesting technical developments. He was a great role model for how Engineers should be respected in an executive capacity as he advanced his career from &#x27;Software&#x27; to &#x27;Product&#x27;. His efforts contributed to technology used by millions. What happened to him is tragic and wrong; he deserved better. Thank you, I&#x27;ll miss you &#x27;crazybob&#x27;.<p>Please share your stories featuring Bob Lee, who I&#x27;m sure would like to be remembered for his contributions rather than as a victim of this unfortunate awful event.",
